# stylish-Dark-Themes

Sometimes I browse the Internet and still find bright websites around (still wondering why...).
I believe some folk haven't realised they are no longer writing on paper but on a screen :/

Here's a collection of missing Dark Themes, or replacement for broken ones, I personally curated.
Therefore, they are pretty by definition ;)

I'm new to the world of CSS & co., so feel free to rise issues and/or provide PRs.

## Themes

For the background, I took inspiration from the amazing work done for [GitHub](https://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark) and [StackExchange](https://github.com/StylishThemes/StackOverflow-Dark).

 - Google Groups ([style](https://userstyles.org/styles/153180/), [doc](google-groups.md), [src](google-groups.css))
 - Jupyter Notebook ([style](https://userstyles.org/styles/153443/), [doc](jupyter-notebook.md), [src](jupyter-notebook.css))
